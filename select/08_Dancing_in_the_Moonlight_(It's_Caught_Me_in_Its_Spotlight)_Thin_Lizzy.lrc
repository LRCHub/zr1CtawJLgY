[00:14.86] When I passed you in the doorway
[00:18.33] Well, you took me with a glance
[00:22.41] I should have took that last bus home
[00:25.16] But I asked you for a dance
[00:28.64] Now we go steady to the pictures
[00:31.29] I always get chocolate stains on my pants
[00:34.66] And my father he's going crazy
[00:39.30] He says I'm living in a trance
[00:54.30] 
[00:40.82] But I'm dancing in the moonlight
[00:43.88] It's caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
[00:47.44] Dancing in the moonlight
[00:50.89] On this long hot summer night
[01:05.39] 
[00:53.86] It's three o'clock in the morning
[01:00.13] And I'm on the streets again
[01:03.98] I disobeyed another warning
[01:07.28] I should have been in by ten
[01:10.16] Now I won't get out until Sunday
[01:13.16] I'll have to say I stayed with friends
[01:16.67] But it's a habit worth forming
[01:19.95] If it means to justify the end
[01:34.95] 
[01:22.37] Dancing in the moonlight
[01:25.52] It's caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
[01:29.70] Dancing in the moonlight
[01:32.03] On this long hot summer night
[01:46.53] 
[01:45.36] And I'm walking home
[01:51.04] The last bus has long gone
[01:58.48] But I'm dancing in the moonlight
[02:14.48] 
[02:32.53] Dancing in the moonlight
[02:35.22] It's caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
[02:39.04] Dancing in the moonlight
[02:41.71] On this long hot summer night
[02:44.98] Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
[02:48.77] It's caught me in its spotlight (It's caught me in its spotlight)
[02:52.32] Dancing in the moonlight (dancing in the moonlight)
[02:54.73] On this long hot summer night (It's got me hot)
[02:58.52] Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
[03:02.02] It's caught me in its spotlight (Its caught me alright, alright, alright)
[03:04.80] Dancing in the moonlight
[03:08.01] On this long hot summer night (It's so god damn hot)
[03:11.54] Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing)
[03:14.27] It's caught me in its spotlight (I'm still dancing)
[03:17.56] Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
[03:21.02] On this long hot summer night
